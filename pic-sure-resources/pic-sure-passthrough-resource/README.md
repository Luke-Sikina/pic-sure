### PIC-SURE Passthrough Resource

A proxy resource that makes queries on behalf of users using the Common Area Service User Account Token for each institution. 
Query submitted to the target resource should not be modified EXCEPT the resource UUID must match the target resource UUID 

This will require three configurations: 
1. common area service account token 
2. target resource UUID 
3. target PIC-SURE URL
